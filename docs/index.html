         <h2>About the HIStory project</h2>
         <p>The HIStory digitizing project aims to digitize and present the rescued personal archive
            of a French priest who received his religious education during the 20s and 30s, was made
            prisoner of war during World War Two (WWII) and who lived the rest of his life in
            Brittany, France.</p>
         <p>HIStory argues for the importance of personal archives as an excellent tool to shed new
            light and perspectives on history and other transdisciplinary academic subjects.</p>
         <p>For the current project, a very limited sample of items has been made available
            online.</p>
         <p>It is understood that the potential meanings at stake rely as much in the association of
            archival items than in a single item and its content. Digital representation with
            XML/TEI potentially allows for flexible interpolations. Furthermore, the association of
            a kept newspaper and a letter may bring much more meaning than those two same items
            considered separately. In that respect, the planned creation of portfolios would allow
            to reflect the analogue archive organization.</p>
         <p>The ambition would be to digitize and make available related personal archives to
            constitute a pool and tool designed to facilitate further interpolated research. While
            far from being a digital scholarly edition, it could potentially become so.</p>
         <p>In its current modest manifestation, the project ambition intersects with the <a
               href="http://www.ego.1939-1945.crhq.cnrs.fr/recherche/rech.php">ÉGO 39-45 écrits de
               guerre project</a> that digitizes individual stories from World War Two in
            France.</p>
         <p>Digitization is not only the alternative to analogue. The use of, for instance, Text
            Encoding Initiative allows for different ways to view, comment upon, and analyse the
            same source. While acknowledging the source in multiple ways, the digitization process
            may create a new and somewhat different object. For this project, the document was
            considered as both object and content carrier and the aim is to offer a diplomatic and a
            reading view of each item. </p>
