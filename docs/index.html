         <h2>About the HIStory project</h2>
         <p>About the HIStory project The HIStory digitizing project aims to digitize and present
            the rescued personal archive of a French priest who received his religious education
            during the 20s and 30s, was made prisoner of war during World War Two (WWII) and who
            lived the rest of his life in Brittany, France. HIStory argues for the importance of
            personal archives as an excellent tool to shed new light and perspectives on history and
            other transdisciplinary academic subjects. For the current project, a very limited
            selection of items has been made available online. It is understood that the potential
            meanings at stake rely as much in the association of archival items than in a single
            item and its content. Indeed, the association of a kept newspaper and a letter may bring
            much more meaning than those two same items considered separately. The ambition would be
            to digitize and make available related personal archives to constitute a pool and tool
            designed to facilitate further interpolated research. While far from being a digital
            scholarly edition (Sahle, 2014, 2016), it could potentially become so. In its modest
            manifestation, the project ambition intersects with the ÉGO (Centre de Recherche
            d'Histoire Quantitative) project that digitizes individual stories from World War Two in
            France. Digitization is not only the alternative to analogue. Indeed, the use of, for
            instance, Text Encoding Initiative allows for different ways to view, comment upon, and
            analyse the same source. While acknowledging the source in multiple ways, the
            digitization process may create a new and somewhat different object (See Björk, 2015).
            For this project the document was considered as both object and content carrier and the
            aim was to offer a diplomatic and a reading view of each item. </p>
