# HIStory. When individual trajectories meet history -  A French priest personal archive: An electronic transcription

This is a sample of a potentially larger digitization project that aims at creating a
research portal where personal archives become the main point of entry for a more
human-centred history where individual trajectories intersect with political and historical events as well as institutions. The project starting point is the display
               of archive material that belonged to one individual, a French priest who was educated
               in the 30s in France, became a war prisoner during WWII and later an advocate for
               freedom of (religious) education. There are many points of (research) interest that
               are raised through one personal archive. Indeed, each archival item acquires its full
               meaning in the context of its own archive. In the case of the French priest archive, it is
               absolutely fascinating to look at the seminar notes and course booklets to deepen our
               understanding of religious, Catholic, education in France in the 1930s. Likewise, the
               material saved over time by one priest reveals an intersting trajectory when thinking
               about the Church position during WWII with regard to Nazi Germany and Vichy France.
               In the case of the priest's personal archive, it is interesting to note that Vichy France
               aligned publications from the early years of WWII had been preserved by the priest.
               Towards, the end of the war and soon after the war, another type of material had been
               considered worthy of keeping. For example, the archive contains a German newspaper
               published in May 1945 that showed in its front page striking photos of victims and
               survisvors at concentration camps. These choices are in themselves meaningful. The personal archive also holds a rare catalogue
               of the exhibition "Hitlerian crimes" that was held at the Grand Palais in Paris in
               the summer 1945. Hence the individual documents, as well as the personal archive as a
               whole offer great research potential about the following themes, but not exclusively:
               Religious catholic education, war prisonners, WWII, the Church establishment, history
               of mentality and Vichy France.
               
  The whole archive in my possession is indeed only a sample of the priest's archive.
               The archive material that I rescued in 2003 from what was sent for garbage collection
               outside the Clarisse Convent, rue de Briseux, in Rennes, is only a sample collected
               at random. Indeed there were many more boxes, many of them had been already contaminated by
               dog urine. I rescued what seemed the most interesting in a few minute timeframe. What
               had originally attacted my eye was the Vichy France publications and the seminar
               notes from the 1930s. Soon after I started going through the few boxes I had
               collected with the aim of indexing the material, but lack of time stopped me in my
               endeavour. In 2022, I finally got an opportunity to get back to this archive that had
               been stored in France. A pre-selection was brought to Sweden where I started to read
               and research the documents. For the digitization project I sampled a few, considered
               most interesting and/or striking documents from three different periods of the
               priest's life: the 1930s, WWII and post WWII.

## About the Developer
This repository was created by Maud Guichard-Marneur in the Spring 2022 as part of a digitizing project at the University of BorÃ¥s, Sweden. This project is a pilot project as part of a Master Program in Library and information science.
The ambition is to developp the project to digitize and present the personal archive in its entirety and/or within the available range allowed by copyright laws/agreements, as relevant.
Maud Guichard-Marneur has worked in the cultural sector and hold a Master in International Museum Studies (University of Gothenburg, Sweden) and a PhD in Cultural studies (University of Copenhagen, Denmark). 
The template for this repository was originally developed by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN) as a teaching tool in the Digitising Cultural Heritage Materials course at the [University of BorÃ¥s](https://www.hb.se/)
